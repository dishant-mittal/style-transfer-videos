This is a project was implemented me, Michael Honke and Rahul Iyer as a part of Deep learning course (offered fall 2017) at University of Waterloo. Photo-realistic style transfer is a technique which transfers colour from one reference domain to another domain by using deep learning and optimization techniques. Here, we present a technique which we use to transfer style and colour from a reference image to entire video. In accomplishing this, we take help from two papers:

* [Deep Photo Style Transfer Luan et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07511)
* [Artistic style transfer for videos Ruder et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08610)

Below are the results of the combined model applied on three different samples:

#### Sample 1:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Input** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Style Image** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Output**
